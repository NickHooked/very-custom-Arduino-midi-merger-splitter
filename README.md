# very-custom-Arduino-midi-merger-splitter
A midi merger/splitter for my specific rig.

Hopefully somebody can use parts of the code for his/her own.

This code is not tested at this moment.

My rig is going to be comprised of:
-a old combo organ(EKO Minstril) which is going to have midi out(I have a git repo for that).
-midi basspedals(I have a git repo for that) which are made from a set of pedals gotten from a GEM Wizard.
-a Korg Volca Bass
-a Korg Volca Keys

I want to be able to controll the Volcas from the different midi sources and switch the audio from the organ on and off.
I also want to be able to only send the lowest note to the bass and only the highest or highest 3 to the keys, so I am working on a solution for thar.
At some point I will also add the option for a split.
